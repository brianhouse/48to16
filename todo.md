- we want clicktrack playback in the client
- video playback? jitter -- receive sync just like player. or send sync?


### latency

if we are so dependent on the clocks being in sync, what's the point of the sync messages, other than kicking it off at the beginning? 

so really need to send and receive pings, get a network latency time, and adjust via that.


### network

see if there are 4 jacks on the wrt, could just use that, has built-in router.
