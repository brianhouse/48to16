Performance Interface for Forty-eight to Sixteen
================================================

[http://brianhouse.net/works/forty_eight_to_sixteen/](http://brianhouse.net/works/forty_eight_to_sixteen/)

Forty-eight to Sixteen documents my daily bicycle commute from Brooklyn to midtown Manhattan with sensors for my heartrate, breathing, and the cadence of my pedaling, along with chest-mounted video. Cellist Topu Lyo interprets my experience via a composition I derived from the sources that is precisely timed with the video. I am interested in 'performing' data and my and Topu's divergent but equally physical relationship to the information. Additionally, the physiological basis of empathy has implications for recent trends in media culture toward first-person viewpoints and the integration of biometrics into documentary. Named after the gear ratio of my bike.
